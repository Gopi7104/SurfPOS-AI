# features/merchant/

Merchant self-serve registration and business-profile management. See docs/05_FEATURES.md § 1.

Not yet implemented. When implementation begins, this folder follows the standard feature-module shape from [07_CODING_RULES.md § 3](../../../../docs/07_CODING_RULES.md#3-folder-conventions):

```

├── domain/         # Entities + use-cases (the actual business rules for this feature)
